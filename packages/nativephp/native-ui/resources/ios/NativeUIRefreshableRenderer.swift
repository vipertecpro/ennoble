import SwiftUI

/// Pull-to-refresh wrapper using SwiftUI's first-class `.refreshable`
/// modifier. Children render inside a vertical `ScrollView`; the
/// platform's native spinner appears when the user pulls down.
///
/// On iOS 17+ this is the canonical pull-to-refresh API — gives real
/// system haptics, accessibility (VoiceOver "pull to refresh" hint),
/// and the rubber-band physics users expect.
///
/// Driven by props:
///   - `on_refresh` (int) — callback ID fired when the user releases
///     the pull past threshold. The refresh spinner stays visible
///     until our `await Task.sleep(800ms)` completes, giving PHP time
///     to handle the event and publish a new tree.
///
/// Children should NOT include their own `<scroll-view>` — this
/// element IS the scrolling container.
